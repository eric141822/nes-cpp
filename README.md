# NES Emulator in C++

This is a NES emulator written in C++. Following the fantastic [write up](https://bugzmanov.github.io/nes_ebook/chapter_1.html) by [bugzmanov](https://github.com/bugzmanov/).

The project is orginally written in Rust, but I ported it to C++ for learning purposes.

- [] CPU (6502) - In progress.
